            <h3>History and our Team</h3>
            <p>Our team has over 200 years of combined knowledge and teaching experience. Our educational leaders, teachers, counsellors & administrators are professionals working towards a common goal—to develop the potential of every student. They hold master’s and doctorate degrees, as well as other teaching credentials and many years of experience. By offering the best teachers, counsellors and administrators to work side by side with every student, we enable the student to reach his or her potential.<br><br>

            Since opening our doors in 2002, we have helped thousands of students in their after-school enrichment education needs. Over the years, we have expanded our programs and services to meet the growing needs of our students. Through early preparation at Opus, many students have been admitted to highly selective universities, have embarked on fulfilling careers and even gained leadership positions in their chosen field.</p>

                    She has extensive experience in education and non-education fields such as Insurance & Finance, Hospitality, and International Business. Over decades of working with immigrant and local families and in the corporate world, Dr. Lim observed overarching themes that emerge in business, education and global leadership – namely that the ability to communicate well, with a firm academic foundation and strong character, empower people to achieve their goals and be their best selves. Dr. Lim’s passion for helping young people acquire superior education led her to establish Opus Academy.<br><br>

                    Dr. Janette Lim holds an Ed.D from Pepperdine University, MBA from Queens University (Canada) and M.Ed. from University of Calgary.

                    <p>Alex Lim is the co-founder and Music Director of Opus Academy. As a music teacher whose experience spans over thirty years, he has worked with many musically gifted students.

Mus degree from the University of British Columbia, a member of the British Columbia’s Registered Music Teachers Association (BCRMTA) and National Association of College Admissions Counselling (NACAC).</p>

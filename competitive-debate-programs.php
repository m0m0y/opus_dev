                <h4>Why learn to debate ?</h4>
            </div>

            <p>The art of debate has been a defining part of Western culture since the ancient Greeks. Through debate, students deepen their understanding of the world and look for solutions to local, national and global issues. Early debate training helps students listen carefully, think logically and speak effectively. Students sharpen their reasoning and problem-solving skills by studying how to construct arguments, defend them through refutation, and cross-examine others. Debate teaches life skills essential to future success and is applicable to most any future career choice.</p>

            <p>Research shows that students who practice debate perform better academically, attain higher standardized test scores, gain increased college admissions, and achiever greater success in their careers. </p>

                <p>This course provides a solid foundation for communication in academic and career contexts. Students will learn the foundational elements of crafting outstanding persuasive speeches. Students will select a contemporary topic with a level of controversy and produce public policy and personal advocacy speeches.</p>

                <p>Public Forum has rapidly become the most popular format of debate both in the United States and internationally. In a public forum debate round, two teams of two students debate for approximately 45 minutes on a national topic that changes throughout the school year. Students will debate several topics over the course of the year and will prepare for regular tournament competitions.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-5">III. Policy Debate- Policy Debate</h5>

                <p>One of the oldest forms of debate competition most common to US high schools and US universities, is also the format favoured for the Harvard Debate Council competitions.

                <h4>University Admissions Counselling</h4>
                <br>
                <h5>The Need</h5>
                <p>Our admissions counsellors offer a wealth of knowledge, experience, and expertise to the university admissions process. Not only do we have a deep and objective understanding of many universities their offerings, the application form, and personal essays, but we also expertly understand the application process in general. Our counsellors stay in touch with current trends and spend much time touring campuses and talking with university counselling professionals and admission officers.Our team-based approach ensures that students gain valuable insights from a multiplicity of perspectives.  </p>

                <br>

                <h5>The Right Choice</h5>
                <p>With so many selective programs to choose from, our team of counsellors will help students and identify their core values and goals, and match them with the best-fit schools for them. Just like the applicants are choosing between programs, schools are selectively looking for students that will fit their vision for their community, so our knowledgeable counselors help students find a university that is right for them. </p>

                <br>

                <h5>Present Your Best You</h5>
                <p>In competitive application processes, often the best way to stand out is through the more creative portion of the application process such as the essays and personal statements. Our counsellors will create a plan for applicants to showcase their individual talents, as well as brainstorm and review essays and personal statements produced by the applicant. Our goal is to help the student craft a unique and compelling story told through each section of their application. </p>

                <br>

                <h5>Interview with confidence</h5>
                <p>Some universities require face-to-face interviews with the applicants. These are high-stakes, nerve-wracking situations, but with preparation, this is where students can make themselves shine. With our expert team of interview coaches and insight into interview processes, we will prepare students so there are no surprises. Each school has something unique they are looking for in prospective students, so our counselors ensure every applicant walks into interview prepared. </p>

                <br>

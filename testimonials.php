                                    <p>This course has not only helped me in my speech practical exams, but my school work as well. Reading through plays and talking about literary works has helped me understand references in school that are foreign to most people. It also gave me more to write about in essays because I can draw on examples from literature I have read. Often, the works that I study in RCM Speech Arts History and Literature courses I use in school as well. The course is good for academic purposes, and in everyday life: it helps me understand references and allusions. Although the course is a lot of work, it is definitely worth it. There is a lot to read and understand, but it is taught in such a way that you have a greater understanding of history by the end. All the literary works have historical and political significance. Also, you gain an understanding of how to read and analyze works of literature beyond the ones you read in class.</p>

                                    <p>Taking the RCM Speech Arts Theory Level 1 course has allowed me to move ahead in school and strive in other courses. When the material from this course is taught in school, I can easily recall what was taught in the course and further expand my knowledge of this material. Also, I am sure that the History and Literature course will help in the same way when our school begins teaching the material. Many courses at Opus Academy have allowed me to be ahead of what is being taught at school</p>

                                    <p>The Opus Speech Arts and Drama Program may be one of the best programs that one could ever take. Speech Arts has helped me not only in my speaking, it has changed who I am, how I perceive the world, and how I act in front of people. Before I took the program, I was always horrified to speak to strangers, even my fellow students I didn’t know. If I had to speak to people, my voice would always be so low that people couldn’t even hear. But now, after three and half years of Speech Arts training, I was nearly voted the person in Grade 10 who did not need megaphone! Not only did the Speech Arts program help me get confidence in my speaking, it has also helped me to be one of the top three students in my English class. I still remember the look on my classmates’ faces when we first began reading Romeo and Juliet, how they were as pale as snow when the teacher announced that we would have to act out Shakespeare in front of the class-but not me! Doing speech arts for so long had prepared me for all this, and I was the only one smiling and joking around about it in my class. I am not exaggerating, they become so jealous and all tried to have me in their Shakespeare scene.</p>   

                                    <p>The theory and the history associated with speech arts also helped me very much in my school life. Thanks to the history courses for speech arts, I can understand easily what the teacher is talking about when it comes to poetry and plays-so much so that I was called by a teacher our class resident poet. Thanks to the theory I learned and my experience in speech arts, I was voted vice-president of my school’s Toastmasters Club. Taking the speech theory course at Opus aided me in my campaign, since I was able to adapt what I learned in Opus and teach it to my fellow club members. No matter how I look at it, speech arts at Opus has changed my life and help me be more active in my school community. The staff and teachers at Opus are very kind and encouraging. They are funny, thoughtful, but also serious when it is demanded. They are excellent people to work with. The facility is also top rated. It is clean, well furnished, and large enough to do what needs to be done. Overall an excellent place to study and learn.</p>

                                    <p>Overall I have learned so much from the Grade 10 speech arts course. I gained a lot of confidence through this course. All the background research and extensive rehearsal we did in class really gave me confidence performing. This course has also taught me the importance of time management and how to be efficient with my work, since I had to spread out my memorization over a span of many weeks. All the skills I have learned from the course may will serve me well in the future.</p>

                                    <p>The way my teacher taught the course made studying easier because I remembered things from the beginning of the course. We managed time wisely and finished the course on time. My teacher was very concise and to-the-point, as well as knowledgeable – I learned something new each time. The teacher always made sure I understood the topic before moving on, and gave good notes which were easy to refer to later. The course helps me in English at school, improving my ability to analyze and understand plays and poems. I have a better sense of English literature and language that will in turn help me in public speaking.</p>

                                    <p>Speech is an intricate act. There are hidden obstacles that can make even a very experienced speaker stumble. My Opus speech teacher has been very helpful in pointing out aspects of speech and persuasion that I would not be able to catch on my own. He taught me specific methods and skills to polish my speeches that enhanced the delivery of message and content. Indeed, speech itself is a natural act, but good speeches are works of art. Through my work with my Opus teacher, I found the process of speech writing and delivery both gratifying and artistically fulfilling. Passion, energy and skill are the three aspects of speech I learned to control and excel in during my 3 years at Opus.</p>

She is extremely talented at literary analysis, providing a very structural and methodical way of examining: content, style, diction and theme. Her specific instructions and insights into effective reading and writing I found lacking even in International Baccalaureate programs and other literary courses have all been Anne’s specialty. Although the study of literature can be tedious and often boring with other instructors, Anne brings one’s understanding of text and content to a deeper, more emotional level that students can honestly connect with. I would recommend her to IB, AP and university students who are having trouble finding a personal understanding of literature.</p>

                                    <p>During the process of my daughter and son’ applications for a private school process. Opus provided the guidance and assistance we needed. The counsellors at Opus gave the most helpful counselling advises to me and my husband in choosing a private school. Our counsellor helped us with filling out the registration forms, guided us through each stage of the application. He also helped us with email and written correspondence. Both my son and daughter are now in a well-known private school in Vancouver. Thank you, Opus!</p>

                                    <p>My name is Katy Lee and I just started attending a boarding school called Rectory School in the United States. I am really enjoying my life there, and now when I look back, I think Opus helped me a lot with improving my English, expanding my vocabulary, improving my articulation, and encouraging me to get this far. I thank all the teachers who have taught me many important skills that I needed when preparing for something big, like applying to Rectory. I never thought these classes such as Current Events, Communication Skills, Speech Arts, or Interview Skills would ever help me, but I really learned a lot through these courses. For example, by taking Current Events class with Shane and Shannon (which was fun!) I learned to care more about what was going on in the world which I think that affected me very much in my history class. My Communication Skills, Speech Arts and Interview Skills helped me improve pronunciation, articulation, and get more comfortable and confident with public speaking, which I didn’t really enjoy doing before. You need to know how to speak in public if you are to attend private boarding schools because the teachers there find it important; further, you need to learn how to behave in an interview in order to get into schools like Rectory or any other wonderful school. I recommend that you take these classes. The teachers are fun, and you learn a lot!</p>

                                    <p>Teacher Anne is one of the best teachers I have met. She is extremely talented in literary analysis, providing a very structural and methodical way of examining: content, style, diction and underlying message. The specific instructions and insights to effective reading and writing I found lacking in even IB programs and other literary courses have all been Anne’s specialty. Although the study of literature can be tedious and often boring, Anne can bring one’s understanding of text and content to a deeper, more emotional level that students can honestly connect with. I would recommend her to IB, AP and university students who have trouble finding a personal understanding of literature.</p>

                                    <p>I remember how I was desperately looking for a good speech and math program one year ago for my grade six boy who was upset about his school performance after living overseas for nearly 11 years. His new schoolteacher in a top Vancouver public school not only assigned him to an ESL class, even though his first language is English, but also commented that his math shows “no basic comprehension”. Luckily, after several months of desperately looking for remedial classes, we were recommended by an experienced English teacher to attend both Opus’ speech and EPGY math programs, which later assessed my son’s math at a much higher level… He is a much happier youth now because of his talented and patient EPGY math tutor, who knows how to challenge him and accelerate his math level over time. For his speech classes, we want to give special thanks to Shannon who has been so kind and so encouraging to my son that he even pushes us to continue his speech lessons “forever”. After taking classes with Shannon since last November, Geoff’s oral presentation and debating skills are dramatically improved, which will help him to reach his personal goals and future career plans. I could not imagine how Geoff could change so much from a depressed student, nearly failing at school, to a confident and hopeful young man. Thank you, Shannon and Darren and Opus -- it’s because of Opus’ outstanding teaching staff that my child has become a good testimony to ‘if you are willing, you can make it</p>

Katy had previously studied English in Korea; however, I found significant differences between the classes in Korea and Opus. The first year at Opus, Katy did not show any great improvement. But now when I think about it, during that year all the different classes she took, especially EPGY courses, must have been gradually strengthening Katy’s weaknesses. The knowledge and the ambition that the teachers in Opus have seem comparable to that of university professors. Specifically, the teachers’ precise understanding of their students and the information they provide were beyond my expectations. Currently, the writing class that Katy once found to be most difficult has become her favourite subject. Also, Katy’s countless experiences on the stage during her speech class have helped her build confidence and skills. Katy is currently taking General Communication Arts, Current Events, and Essay Writing courses and she says that these classes are very helpful. Katy likes that she gets to choose the books and the topics to present to the class. Also, Katy feels proud that she is acquiring new vocabulary to expand her knowledge. The Current Events class is a great way for Katy to become involved in the world. She asks about my own opinions on certain events or incidents so that I also have to keep up with the current news issues. As a mother, I am so happy to see my daughter becoming a global citizen. I am so grateful to Opus.</p>

OPUS teachers and counsellors have extremely rich experience in both subject and counselling areas, and their professional level is definitely the best in the industry. I was deeply impressed by the thoroughness, accuracy and dedication of their work.

I want to thank counsellor/teacher Joby for guiding my daughter every step of the way through her application process; and the front desk staff, Caroline in particular, for making my daughter always felt welcomed and cared for with their kindness and helpfulness.

                                    <p>The interview skills course was a great class for my son. It provides essential information and guidelines on how to prepare for an interview when applying for a private school. My son enjoyed the class and learned many interview skills from instructor and all other staffs. Opus Academy offers a wide variety of courses for students in all levels and always provides suggestions and recommends the specific course for different students with their own needs.</p>

                                    <p>My daughter was successfully admitted to the Crofton House School last fall. My special thanks go to Opus Academy for the Interview Skills training course. This course is highly target-oriented, and covers a wide range of content, from how to make an eye contact and shake hands to how to answer the interviewer's questions with ease and calmness. It teaches children confidence, adaptability and flexibility. The teachers at Opus are kind, patient and very professional. They design their lesson plans based on a child’s needs. I would strongly recommend this course to children who want to get into a prestigious school.</p>

He enjoys to come to classes at Opus and has made great progress. In January 2015, he applied for St. George’s School and took the entrance exam. He successfully passed the exam and was admitted to the school. The teaching methods at Opus Academy are very distinctive, which stimulate children's love of learning and cultivate good study habits. Thanks to the Opus Academy for teaching and mentoring my son for the past eight months!</p>

                                    <p>Applying for a US university is much more complicated and competitive than applying for a Canadian university. From SAT tests preparation, AP courses, and common application essays to extracurricular activities... The amount of work is huge and often intimidating. Looking back my daughter’s entire process of applying for a US university, I feel very fortunate to have the help of an excellent team like OPUS Academy. OPUS teachers and counsellors have extremely rich experience in both subject and counselling areas, and their professional level is definitely the best in the industry. I was deeply impressed by the thoroughness, accuracy and dedication of their work. Every member of the OPUS team, from the administrative staff to the teachers, treats the client with sincerity and professionalism. I want to thank counsellor/teacher Joby for guiding my daughter every step of the way through her application process; and the front desk staff, Caroline in particular, for making my daughter always felt welcomed and cared for with their kindness and helpfulness. As a result, my daughter received admission letters from UCLA, USC, and NYU, which she had dreamed for but was intimidated to apply before getting help from Opus.</p>

                                    <p>Teacher Anne is one of the best teachers I have met. She is extremely talented in literary analysis, providing a very structural and methodical way of examining: content, style, diction and underlying message. The specific instructions and insights to effective reading and writing I found lacking in even IB programs and other literary courses have all been Anne’s specialty. Although the study of literature can be tedious and often boring, Anne can bring one’s understanding of text and content to a deeper, more emotional level that students can honestly connect with. I would recommend her to IB, AP and university students who have trouble finding a personal understanding of literature.</p>

                                    <p>Despite the short two-week stay, the Pre-Collegiate Camp at Stanford was a valuable experience. Our schedule was packed with a diverse range of courses taught by insightful professors who all encouraged a passion for learning and curiosity. In addition, we went on field trips to places like San Francisco and the Computer History Museum; our counselors also organized activities like the talent show or the fire pit night, during which I met new people from other countries and learned about their culture. These two weeks have opened my eyes to college life and enabled me to gain an understanding of topics not conventionally taught in high school; it has definitely been a fruitful adventure</p>

                <p>We encourage preparing students for a variety of exams, as the results can play a determining role in their futures. Our test preparation courses begin with a diagnostic exam and continues with the development of a plan which is customized according to the student’s individual needs. We track student progress throughout the length of the program and administer practice exams under simulated test conditions. Test reports are used to review and identify areas for further skill strengthening as well as suggestions on how to study efficiently. Our goal is twofold: to raise students’ test scores, but also to equip them with real, lasting critical reasoning skills. The test-taking strategies and skills learned benefit students throughout their academic journey. </p>

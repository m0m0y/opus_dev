                    <p>In the fast-paced and ever-changing world of the 21st century, it is critical for young minds to be prepared for the world at large by increasing their global awareness. At Opus, we introduce and engage students in the global effects of economic, social, and political processes, as well as issues of justice and responsibility through three courses: Current Events, Model UN, and Mock Trial. </p><br>

                    <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Current Events </p>
                    <p>This course increases young people's awareness of and responsiveness to issues and events that are important locally, nationally, and internationally.  Students learn to differentiate between fact and opinion, as well as to critically analyze news and various media sources, developing their own perspectives in the process. Students will be equipped to not only engage with the news around them, but contribute to a wide range of topics and discussions on a global scale.</p> <br>

                    <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Model United Nations</p>
                    <p>This course teaches the basics of constructing and analyzing diplomatic speeches, as well as constructing and presenting successful negotiation strategies. Students are assigned roles and given specific diplomatic goals to meet by the end of the conference. Students will develop the skills necessary to interpret, analyze, and debate global issues concerning diplomacy, politics, and international relations.</p> <br>

                    <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Mock Trial</p>
                    <p>The Opus Mock Trial Program trains students to plan, draft, and present their claims for cross-examining and delivering opening and closing arguments. It additionally instructs students how to argue intelligently and logically while conducting courtroom procedures such as introducing material evidence and responding to objections. Students will increase their confidence, poise, oral skills, critical thinking skills, and teamwork.</p>
